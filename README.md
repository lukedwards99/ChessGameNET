# ChessGameNET

This was a project for my .NET class at NIU. The project can be opened with the .csproj file even though it has a weird name (it was part of the assignment submission).

It was built using .NET framework 4.7.3. (It should have been done in .NET 6 but I am not the professor ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)
